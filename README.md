# sugar-sugar
A fun game to test your glucose-predicting superpowers! 🎯

Ever wondered how good you are at predicting where your glucose levels are heading? sugar-sugar turns this into an engaging game where you test your glucose-spotting skills against real CGM data.

## How It Works

1. **Load Your Data**: Upload your own Dexcom or Libre CSV file, or use our example dataset (At the momemt we haven't yet fully tested the load your own data function-however the sample dataset is available and working)
2. **Make Predictions**: Click and draw on the glucose chart to predict future glucose values
3. **Compare Results**: Your predictions are compared against the actual glucose values from the file
4. **See Your Accuracy**: Get detailed metrics showing how close your predictions were to reality

The game shows you historical glucose data up to a certain point, then challenges you to predict what happens next. Since the file contains the actual "ground truth" values, we can precisely measure how accurate your human intuition is compared to what really happened.

Why did we create this? While fancy AI models are being built to predict glucose values, we realized nobody really knows how good humans are at this - especially experienced CGM users who've developed an instinct for their patterns. By playing sugar-sugar, you're not just having fun, you're also helping us understand:
- How accurate are humans at predicting glucose trends?
- What patterns do experienced CGM users notice that computers might miss?
- Could this help make better prediction tools in the future?

> 🎵 Fun fact: The name "sugar-sugar" was inspired by a scientific remake of The Archies' classic hit song ["Sugar, Sugar"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJvAL-iiLnQ) from 1969!

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- UV (Python package manager)

### Installing UV
1. **Windows/macOS/Linux**:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Alternative method** (using pip):
```bash
pip install uv
```

3. **Using Homebrew** (macOS):
```bash
brew install uv
```

For detailed installation instructions, visit the [UV documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GlucoseDAO/sugar-sugar.git
cd sugar-sugar
```

2. Install dependencies using UV:
```bash
uv sync
```

3. Install development dependencies (optional):
```bash
uv sync --group dev
```

### Configuration
1. Copy the environment template and customize your settings:
```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

2. Edit `.env` to configure your server settings:
```bash
# Dash Application Configuration
DASH_HOST=127.0.0.1      # Host to run the server on
DASH_PORT=8050           # Port to run the server on
DASH_DEBUG=True          # Enable Dash debug mode
DEBUG_MODE=False         # Enable application debug features (test button)
```

### Running the Game
```bash
uv run start
```

You can also override configuration via command line:
```bash
# Run on a different host/port
uv run start --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000

# Enable debug mode for development
uv run start --debug

# Combine options
uv run start --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000 --debug
```

Note: Debug mode adds a "Just Test Me" button for quickly filling in the form during development.

### Quick Chart Debugging

To skip the landing/startup/consent pages and jump straight to the prediction chart:
```bash
uv run chart
```

This loads the example dataset, pre-fills test user info, and opens the prediction page immediately. You can also point it at your own CSV:
```bash
# Load an external Dexcom/Libre/Medtronic CSV
uv run chart --file /path/to/export.csv

# Pre-fill predictions with noisy ground truth (test submit/ending without drawing)
uv run chart --prefill
uv run chart --prefill --noise 0.10   # +/-10% noise

# Control the data window
uv run chart --points 48 --start 100

# Use mmol/L units and German locale
uv run chart --unit mmol/L --locale de

# Custom host/port
uv run chart --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```

## KNOWN ISSUES:

- Currently only Dexcom and Libre 3 are supported. We will add support for other CGM devices soon.
- No scoring system and difficulty levels yet.
- Import your own data hasn't been fully tested

## FAQ

### Is this production-ready software?
This is an early-stage project meant for research and experimentation. The app now supports multiple users with session-based state management.

### Do you use my personal data?
Sugar-sugar supports **two modes**:

- **Play-only mode**: if you check **"I just want to play (do not store my CGM / gameplay data)"** on the landing page, the app will **not save study outputs** (no prediction statistics are written).
- **Study mode** (default): if you do *not* check play-only, the app may write **consent + study outputs** to CSV for research.

Notes:

- **Raw uploaded CGM files are used to run the game**. The app is designed to avoid keeping raw uploads permanently.
- In **study mode**, the app writes derived outputs (e.g. predictions vs ground truth + accuracy metrics) to `data/input/prediction_statistics.csv` and ranking info to `data/input/prediction_ranking.csv`.
- Consent choices are recorded to `data/input/consent_agreement.csv` (keyed by the same `study_id`).

### How accurate can glucose predictions be?
Glucose prediction is complex! Research shows that CGM data alone often isn't enough for highly accurate predictions. Other factors like physical activity, meals, insulin, and stress play crucial roles. For a deep dive into state-of-the-art machine learning approaches to glucose prediction, check out [GlucoBench](https://github.com/IrinaStatsLab/GlucoBench) ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05780)), which provides benchmarks and datasets for glucose prediction models.

## Technical Architecture

sugar-sugar is built with [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/), creating an interactive web application for glucose prediction gaming. The app uses session-based state management to support multiple users and processes CGM data from Dexcom and Libre devices.
